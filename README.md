# hello-world

Hello there! GitHub said that I need to talk about myself in this readme file.
OK, GitHub, I'll try. Name - Semen(no,it's just a name, rus/ukr good name),
Student on IT department in Warsaw, now I'm looking for job. How interesting. 
I like this README file. It will be my diary, if I don't forget about it, ofc.
So, my new Diary, see ya later.
